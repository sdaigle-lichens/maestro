// SubagentStart hook for worker subagents.
// Reads <cwd>/.claude/maestro.json (v3), looks up the invoked agent type's instance
// in the active workflow, and emits as additionalContext:
//   1a. loaded_skills     — skills to load (Skill tool) before working,
//   1b. referenced_skills — skills available, loaded only if the task needs them,
//   2. the HANDOFF routing lines this agent may emit (success + condition labels), each paired
//      with the channel file to WRITE its payload to (`.claude/channels/<receiver>/<sender>.1.md`),
//      resolved across three tiers (.claude/handoffs/<sender>/<receiver>.md, then
//      ~/.claude/maestro-handoff-defaults.sqlite, then the seed constant that ships inside
//      lib/maestro-session.cjs) so the whole communication layer lives here rather than in
//      each agent file.
// The skills/routing block above is a no-op when maestro.json is absent, not v3, or the agent
// type is not mapped to any workflow node.
//
// A THIRD, INDEPENDENT branch (`036`) delivers whatever is waiting for this agent's BARE type in
// `.claude/channels/<bareAgentType>/` — same-run files inlined and retired, everything else only
// mentioned. See apps/maestro/src/core/handoff-channels.ts. Gated on nothing but the lane having
// files in it: a channel is a filesystem fact, not a workflow-routing one, which is what lets a
// gap reach `@scribe` on a later run even when this run's workflow never wired a route to it.
//
// A FOURTH, INDEPENDENT branch resolves this agent's "Mandatory Output Format" report (project
// override at .claude/reports/<id>.md, else the global default in
// ~/.claude/maestro-report-defaults.sqlite, else nothing) and injects it as its own
// additionalContext part. Deliberately NOT gated on matchedInstances / a resolved workflow, and
// not gated on maestro.json existing at all: a report has to reach an agent used outside
// Maestro's routing (or in a project with no maestro.json, for the global tier) exactly as the
// static `## Mandatory Output Format` section it replaced always did. See
// apps/maestro/src/core/report-resolution.ts for the same order, applied pure-side for the app's
// /agents page.
//
// `SubagentStart` fires again on a RESUME (`039` — a condition edge routing back to an agent that
// already ran this session, `SendMessage`d instead of dispatched cold). Everything above except
// the channel delivery and the warning is therefore already verbatim in the resumed agent's own
// history — re-injecting it is 500-700 tokens of exact repetition, and `loaded_skills` is worse
// than waste: it is an instruction to redo a tool call. `040` detects that case with
// `hasCompletedRun` (a `kind:"handoff"` entry already logged for this `agent_id`, in the SAME
// per-run log `039` reads) and swaps the five static blocks — loaded/referenced skills, HANDOFF
// routing, per-route protocols, and the report — for one line. The channel delivery is NOT
// skipped: a payload may have arrived in this agent's lane between its two runs, and it doesn't
// duplicate on its own (`retire()` already moved the first run's file to `.consumed/`).
