// The readiness check: can this project orchestrate right now, and if not, which ONE command
// fixes it? Run by the maestro-step0 hook when the orchestrator skill is invoked — which is what
// `checkRuntime(projectDir)` is for. It is ALSO a CLI, for a human debugging a project by hand and
// for /maestro-install's own reporting; the orchestrator skill no longer runs it, or mentions it.
//
// It answers with two fields the caller reads and nothing else: `action`, one of three values,
// and `instruction`, the sentence to obey.
//
//   continue  — nothing to do; get on with the workflow.
//   install   — the project's Maestro config is missing or unusable. Run /maestro-install.
//   update    — the config is fine but what was rendered or copied from it is behind.
//               Run /maestro-update.
//
// Both exist so SKILL.md carries no branch table at all. There are more states here than
// behaviours, and the collapse belongs in code: prose that re-derives it is re-read at the top of
// every single orchestration, costs tokens on every run including the healthy one, and getting it
// subtly wrong either blocks a healthy project or lets a broken one run. The wording travels with
// the logic instead, so the two can never disagree. `reason` and the raw fields below it are for a
// human debugging why, and for `install` to quote back at the user.
//
// The name says "runtime" because that is what this checks, in the sense the `updating-maestro`
// skill uses the word: the project-local COPY of everything the plugin ships — scripts, the
// rendered orchestrator skill, and the maestro.json they read. Not just a version string.
//
// WHAT IT LOOKS AT, in order, because the cheapest and most fundamental failures come first:
//
//   1. .claude/maestro.json exists and is v3.       → else `install`
//   2. It actually configures workflows.            → else `install`
//   3. The orchestrator skill is on disk.           → else `install`
//   4. Every runtime script the skill INVOKES by     → else `update`
//      $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR path is copied beside
//      this one.
//   5. Its <!-- Maestro:HANDOFFS --> table matches   → else `update`
//      what maestro.json renders to TODAY.
//   6. maestro.json's stamped `runtimeVersion`      → else `update`
//      matches the plugin the marketplace last
//      pulled.
//
// Check 4 exists for one script in particular. `maestro-step1-gates.cjs` is named by the
// orchestrator's Step 1 as an INJECTED command (!`node …`), and an injected command that exits
// non-zero aborts the whole skill invocation — so on a project whose runtime predates that file,
// `/maestro` does not degrade, it fails outright, before the model sees a word of the body. This
// check is what is supposed to say "run /maestro-update" first. It is a presence test only: the
// script itself never fails, it only ever prints a line (see its header).
//
// Check 5 is the one nothing else catches. The orchestrator routes work by reading that table; a
// hand-edited maestro.json whose table was never re-rendered sends work down a path that is not
// the configured one, silently and forever. `handoffTable()` is imported from the renderer rather
// than reimplemented so the comparison can never drift from what a re-render would produce.
//
// Check 6 is the original purpose, and the reason it needs installed_plugins.json: a bare terminal
// session has no access to the app's checkout of plugins/maestro (it may not even be on this
// machine), so it can't read a plugin.json the way apps/maestro/src/core/install.ts's
// shippedRuntimeVersion() does. What it CAN read is the same thing the app's pluginHooksActive
// check reads: ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json, which names the version and installPath
// of whatever the marketplace last pulled — the version that would actually apply if the runtime
// were refreshed right now.
//
// Check 6 alone degrades to `continue` (with ok:false) when it cannot be answered: an unreadable
// installed_plugins.json, or the maestro plugin not installed via a marketplace on this machine at
// all (a project-local-only setup, or the app-only delivery path, has nothing here to compare
// against — that project's runtime is refreshed by the app instead). Checks 1–5 need nothing
// outside the project, so they always have an answer.
//
// Never throws, never writes anything — it only ANSWERS.

// must never get a stack trace where it expects one line of JSON.
