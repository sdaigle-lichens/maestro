// Maestro epics (`084`): create an epic, link or unlink tasks, show an epic with its tasks'
// statuses, and the durable inbox: reports from a worker session's done step to the manager, and
// cross-epic notes from one epic's manager to another's (`085`).
// The mechanics live in lib/maestro-epic.cjs (generated from apps/maestro/src/core/epics.ts); this
// script is argument parsing and output. Project root: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, then the cwd.
//
//   node maestro-epic.cjs create <slug> [--goal "<text>"] [--manager "<session name>"]
//   node maestro-epic.cjs list [--json]
//       Every epic with its manager session NAME ("(none recorded)" if none) and how many reports
//       and notes wait for its acknowledgement: how one manager finds the others (`085`).
//   node maestro-epic.cjs link <slug> <NNN-task.md>...      writes `epic` on each task's tracker entry
//   node maestro-epic.cjs unlink <NNN-task.md>...           removes it again
//       Both are all or nothing: a task that does not exist is named and NOTHING is written (exit 1).
//   node maestro-epic.cjs show <slug> [--json]
//       The epic's manager and worker session NAMES, its tasks with their statuses and, for a
//       running task, the NAME of the session that claimed it (or "(unnamed)"), every
//       unacknowledged report and cross-epic note with its file path, and the cross-epic
//       dependencies: blockedBy edges between this epic's tasks and tasks of another epic (or of
//       none) whose blocker is not done yet. Task membership is read from the tracker.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs ready <slug> [--cap <n>] [--json]
//       `125`: the manager's spawn list. The epic's tasks that are ready (tracker `ready`, every
//       blocker done) and that no live session has claimed, oldest first, each with the worker
//       session name to give it and the exact `claude -n <name> '/maestro <task.md>'` command, run
//       from the main checkout it prints. Also the running tasks (live claim) and the pending ones (a
//       worker is recorded for the task with add-worker but has not claimed it yet), which are never
//       listed as ready, and how many slots the cap (default 5) leaves free.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs set-manager <slug> [<session name>]
//   node maestro-epic.cjs add-worker <slug> <session name> [--task <NNN-task.md>] [--pane <herdr pane id>]
//       `176`: --pane records the worker's herdr pane id; `show` lists it. A containerized worker
//       cannot be reached with SendMessage: the manager replies with `herdr pane run <pane> "<text>"`.
//       Output wording: with MAESTRO_WORKER_RUNTIME=docker set (a containerized worker), `report`, `note`
//       and `review-request` say no SendMessage or ListAgents is needed (the manager watches the inbox)
//       and a recorded manager is enough for a manager review.
//       `113`: every name the caller records about ITSELF (create --manager, set-manager,
//       report --from, note --from, ack --by) is filled in from the name the session-name hook
//       stored for this session (`maestro-<id8>`, `maestro-mgr-<id8>`, or the user's custom title),
//       in preference to a passed one; the passed name is only the fallback. add-worker, which a
//       manager runs FOR a worker, prefers the name recorded on the --task claim instead (and the
//       caller's own stored name only when the caller is a worker that is not the epic's manager).
//   node maestro-epic.cjs remove-worker <slug> <session name>
//   node maestro-epic.cjs finish-worker <slug> <session name>
//       `180`: run after the USER confirmed the worker's session was stopped. Marks the worker
//       finished and drops its pane id, so `show` no longer lists it or its pane as active.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs of <NNN-task.md>
//       Prints the slug of the epic the task belongs to, or nothing (exit 0) when it belongs to none.
//       The orchestrator runs it once, when it builds the task list, to word the last node.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs report --task <NNN-task.md> [--file <path>|-] [--from "<session name>"]
//       The orchestrator's report step. `--from` defaults to the session name recorded on the task's
//       claim, when that claim still exists (`done` deletes it, so the command it prints carries --from).
//       Writes the report body (a file, or stdin when --file is "-" or
//       omitted) into the inbox of the epic the task belongs to and logs it. Prints the report file
//       path and, when the epic has a manager recorded, the name to message. A task that belongs
//       to no epic prints a single line and exits 0: nothing else happens.
//       `170`: a report for a task that is done (tracker status `done`, or an `Outcome: done` /
//       `Status: done` line in the body) is REFUSED, exit 1 and nothing written, unless it names a
//       commit SHA that exists and is on the task branch task-NNN (and not already on the default
//       branch while task-NNN is unmerged) or, with no task-NNN branch, on the default branch.
//       The refusal names what is missing: no SHA, no such commit, or not on the branch.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs note <to-slug> --from-epic <slug> [--from "<session name>"] [--subject "<text>"] --file <path>|-
//       A manager's cross-epic note (`085`). Writes the body (a file, or stdin for "-") into the
//       OTHER epic's inbox as nNNN-from-<slug>.md and logs it, both before printing. Prints the
//       note path and the receiving manager's session name to message, or says none is recorded
//       and a resumed manager will list it. Refuses an unknown epic on either side, a note to the
//       sender's own epic, and an empty body. A note is a teammate's request, never the user's approval.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs review-request --task <NNN-task.md> --file <review file> [--from "<session name>"]
//       `132`: a worker at a `manager review` stop records its direction brief (the round's review
//       file, which must already exist) as a review request mNNN, numbered as the ticket's next
//       round, and prints the one line to send the manager plus the redirects recorded so far. A
//       re-run with the same file while the request waits is a re-send, not a new round. A task in
//       no epic, or an epic with no manager recorded, prints the fallback: a human review.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs review-verdict --task <NNN-task.md> <on-track|redirect|escalate> [--by "<session name>"]
//       `132`: records the verdict on the ticket's latest review request. The manager runs it when it
//       decides, the worker when it receives the reply; the second caller gets the recorded verdict
//       back. Manager redirects are counted per ticket here (not plan.loopbacks): with 1 already
//       recorded (`150`), a second redirect is recorded and printed as escalate.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs reports <slug>
//       the unacknowledged reports and notes, and the review requests waiting for a verdict, oldest first
//   node maestro-epic.cjs watch <slug> [--for <seconds>] [--interval <seconds>]
//       `176`: the manager's inbox watcher, meant to run under Monitor. Prints one line per unacknowledged
//       report, note and unanswered review request, in the words of a worker's SendMessage line
//       ("report r003 for 087-x.md is in <file>"): those already waiting when it starts, then each new
//       arrival, each once per run. It reads the ack and verdict state and writes nothing, so an acked
//       entry is never announced and a restarted watcher loses nothing. Exits 0 after --for seconds
//       (default 1500, capped at 1740, below Monitor's 30-minute limit): the manager re-arms it.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs ack <slug> <id>... [--by "<session name>"]
//       Record that the manager received a report (rNNN) or a note (nNNN). Cross-session messages
//       have no delivery receipt, so the acknowledgement lives in the epic's state.
//       `171`: each ack addresses exactly one entry. An id two entries share (an inbox written
//       before `171`) is refused with each entry's handle (`r009-167`); `reports` prints that handle
//       in place of the id, and `ack` takes it, or the report's file name, like an id.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs approve --task <NNN-task.md> --stop "<human review|commit|merge>" --commit <sha> --decision <approved|rejected>
//                          [--note "<text>"] [--suite <green|red|partial>] [--escalation <reason,...>] [--op "<git command>"] [--paths <a,b>]
//       `177`: the manager's own decision on a containerized worker's stop, written to the approvals
//       directory (~/.config/maestro/approvals, outside the repo, mounted read-only into workers).
//       Needs `manager_approval: true` in maestro.json. An approval is REFUSED when the suite is not
//       green or any escalation reason applies (scope change, decision conflict, a push or other
//       outward/destructive git operation, a change to agents/skills/workflows/rules/settings, a
//       security finding, a second redirect), or while an escalation awaits the user. A rejection is
//       always recorded (with --note). Refused inside a worker container.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs approval-escalate --task <NNN-task.md> --stop "<stop>" --commit <sha> --reason <reason>
//       `177`: marks the stop as needing the user and prints the AskUserQuestion to ask in THIS
//       (manager) session. The user's answer is recorded by the AskUserQuestion hook, never by the
//       manager.
//   node maestro-epic.cjs approval-check --task <NNN-task.md> --stop "<stop>" [--commit <sha>]
//       `177`: a containerized worker's gate. Exit 0 and `APPROVED` only when a record exists for
//       exactly this task, stop and commit (default: HEAD); otherwise the reason and exit 2, or
//       `NOT-APPLICABLE` (exit 4) when manager approval is off or this is a host worker (ask the user).
//   node maestro-epic.cjs boundary <slug> start|end [--force]
//       Decides whether the epic's start or end step is due, claims it and writes its scope, then
//       prints one line: nothing configured, not due with the reason, already ran, or the skills to
//       run (start_skills.maestro_manager / end_skills.maestro_manager) with the absolute path of
//       the scope file, whose lines are relative to the git root, and its path count. The run is
//       claimed when the line is printed, so a boundary runs at most once; --force re-runs a claimed
//       boundary (never one that was not due) and keeps the recorded base commit. Exit 1 on an
//       unknown epic or a bad phase, otherwise 0.
//
// Every write reads the file immediately before writing and changes only its own entries, so the
// manager and the workers can write at the same time without losing each other's work.
