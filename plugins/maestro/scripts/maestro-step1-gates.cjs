// Prints this project's Step 1 gate configuration as ONE directive line, for injection into the
// orchestrator skill body through Claude Code's !`command` dynamic-context syntax:
//
//   !`node "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.claude/scripts/maestro-step1-gates.cjs"`
//
// Reads `gates` from <projectDir>/.claude/maestro.json and prints THE WHOLE OF STEP 1 for this
// project — not a flag the skill body then branches on. All four combinations are valid and none is
// nested under another: the design check runs on its own perfectly well, and neither on means the
// line simply says to continue to Step 2.
//
// The template's Step 1 is three lines that amount to "do what the injected line says", plus the
// one thing this script cannot speak to: what to do when its output never arrives at all. Keep it
// that way. Moving a branch back into SKILL.md costs tokens on every orchestration including the
// default (both gates off) and gives the wording somewhere to drift from the logic — the argument
// maestro-check-runtime.cjs's header already makes at length.
//
// THE CONTRACT, and every clause of it is load-bearing:
//
//   * Takes NO arguments.
//   * Exits 0 unconditionally, and writes NOTHING to stderr. There is no failure branch. An
//     injected command that exits non-zero ABORTS the whole skill invocation, and Claude then
//     never sees the orchestrator body at all — so every degenerate case (no maestro.json, a
//     corrupt one, version !== 3, no `gates`, a `gates` that isn't a plain object, a gate whose
//     value isn't a boolean, any unexpected throw) resolves quietly to LINES.none rather than
//     to an error. That is the same "absent means off" stance `resolveGates` takes in
//     apps/maestro/src/core/config.ts, which this file mirrors — it cannot import from src/core,
//     so a change to that rule needs the same change here.
//   * Writes exactly one newline-terminated line on stdout, one of the four in LINES below. One
//     line even though each is now several sentences: it keeps the contract trivially assertable,
//     and the skill body refers to "the line above".
//
// Self-contained on purpose: the installers copy it into the project's .claude/scripts/ so the
// orchestrator skill can name it by $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR path.
